## To open simple page examples

Start from the repository root

1. Make sure you have the Python installed.
2. Start simple HTTP server in Python:
Python 2: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```
Python 3: ```python -m http.server 8000 ```
3. Open a simple page example in your browser
```localhost:8000/relative_path_to_the_page_file```

for example:
```localhost:8000/sandbox/lite_application/index.html```

If you have changed the server port, use it in the URL accordingly.
